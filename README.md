## What can we do to improve the application?
1. We Can use Localstorage to store the todolist items. If we refresh the webpage it cannot be disappear.
2. Some UI changes.
3. Add Date of Completion of Task. Add Due Date of Todo. If Due date expires We can show the alert to the user.
4. We Can use srviceworkers to make the app Progressive and if we are in offline mode the todolist was shown by using serviceworkers.
5. We can add Edit feature to edit the particular todolist item.
